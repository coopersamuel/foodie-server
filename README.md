# Metro Server

### Getting started

Before running the server, you'll need to set up your `.env` file. This file has database keys, url, etc. needed for running the app. Reach out to @coopersamuel for this.

Get the server running with:

```
git clone
cd metro-server/
npm install
npm run server
```

Now, point your browser to `localhost:3000/graphql` to test out the GraphQL API. From here you can make queries and mutations.

### Developer guidelines

##### Branching

Create branches off of the `develop` branch with the `name/branch-name` format, ie. `sam/some-branch-content`
